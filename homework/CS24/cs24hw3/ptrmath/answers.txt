Answers for the "Arrays, Pointer Arithmetic, and Structs" section of CS24 HW3:

1.
p (bytes separated by bars):
0 | 0 | 0 | EF | BE | AD | DE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | BE | BA | FE | CA
Explanation:
The first line sets the int starting at p + 3 * sizeof(char) = p + 3 bytes to
0xDEADBEEF. This takes up bytes 4, 5, 6, and 7 (counting from 1).
The second line sets the int starting at p + 3 * sizeof(int) = p + 12 bytes to
0xCAFEBABE. This takes up bytes 13, 14, 15, 16 (counting from 1).
Since it is little endian, we reverse the order of the bytes.

2.
entry has three parts:

int id:
This takes 4 bytes, as that is the size of an int. It does not require any
padding as it is already a full word. So, 4 used, 0 wasted.

char code[5]:
This takes 5 * 1 = 5 bytes (1 for each of the five in the array). It will be
padded to 8 bytes to keep alignment, and its offset will be 4 bytes.
So, 5 bytes used, 4 byte offset.

entry* next:
Since it is a 32-bit system, all memory addresses are at most 32 bits long, or
4 bytes. So, the pointer to the next takes 4 bytes. To keep alignment the previous one ended mid word, so a padding of 3 bytes is needed.
So, 4 bytes used, 12 byte offset.

In total, this entry struct will use: 4 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 16 bytes, of which 3
bytes is padding and so will be unused.

3.
Let us consider the location of arr[4].code[3]. First, there are three full
entry structs before this. So, 16 * 4 = 64 bytes. Then, there is an int, and
two chars. So, 4 + 3 * 1 = 7 bytes. So, this refers to the 64 + 6 = 71th byte.
So, offset = 71 would result in the two lines writing to the same byte.
