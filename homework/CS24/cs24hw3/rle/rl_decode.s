# rl_decode:  decode RLE-encoded input into a malloc'd buffer
#
# Author:  Ben Bitdiddle (those guys are lucky I said I'd do this before
#          going on my vacation.  they never appreciate my work ethic!)
#
# Arguments to rl_decode are at these stack locations:
#
#      8(%ebp) = data buffer containing run-length encoded input data
#
#     12(%ebp) = length of the run-length-encoded data in the buffer
#
#     16(%ebp) = OUTPUT pointer to where the length of the decoded result
#                should be stored
#
# Return-value in %eax is the pointer to the malloc'd buffer containing
# the decoded data.
#
