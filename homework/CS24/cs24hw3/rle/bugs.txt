The bug numbers correspond to the (Bug n) tags in rl_decode.s.

Bug 1 (lines 35, 45, 46):
%bl is not large enough to hold some of the lengths; as a result, the size comes
off by a factor of 256 due to overflows. So, we must use a larger register in
order to be able to hold the entire value.

Bug 2 (line 47):
Need to be going forward two bytes to skip to next odd as that is where the next
count is located; the skipped byte contains the actual character to write the
count number of times, which is not what we want to look at.

Bug 3 (line 62):
malloc overwrites %ecx, which we were using to hold the memory address of the
data buffer. So, after calling malloc we must move that argument back into %ecx.

Bug 4 (line 80):
Everytime something is written into the memory address %edi points to, %edi must
be incremented so that the next time something is written to the address that
%edi is in, it does not overwrite what was just written, but it put in the next
byte.
