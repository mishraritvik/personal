movl 8(%ebp), %eax           # moves the first argument to eax
imull $3, %eax               # multiplies by 3
addl $12, %eax               # adds 12
imull 8(%ebp), %eax          # mutiplies by the first argument
subl $17, %eax               # subtracts 17

Let x be the first argument. Then, at the end of this eax contains:
(((x * 3) + 12) * x) - 17 = 3x ^ 2 + 12 * x - 17
