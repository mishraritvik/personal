Part 1. Stride

For src: stride of 1.
For dst: stride of SIZE.

Part 2. Minimum Distance

64 bytes.
Each cache set had eight cache blocks of 64 bytes. They are all adjacent, so the
minimum distance is the distance it takes to guarantee that two addresses are
not in the same block of 64 bytes, which is 64 bytes.

Part 3. Worst Case
