Part 1. Stride

For src: stride of 1.
For dst: stride of SIZE.


Part 2. Minimum Distance

Answer: 64 bytes
Each cache set had 8 cache blocks of 64 bytes each. They are all adjacent in
memory, so the minimum distance is the distance it takes to guarantee that two
addresses are not in the same block of 64 bytes, which is 64 bytes. It is
still possible for two adjacent addresses to be in different cache blocks if
they are on the edge of that block, and it is possible for two addresses that
are 64 bytes apart to be in different sets if they are near the edge of the set.


Part 3. Worst Case

Answer: 8192
The worst case is when there is always a cache miss when accessing dst. There
are 512 cache blocks, and each can hold 16 dwords. Since the stride of dst is
much larger than src, we can assume that almost all of the blocks will be used
for dst, so for simplicity we assume all 512 are used for dst. Then, SIZE will
need to be at least 512 * 16 = 8192 in order for every request for dst to be a
cache miss. Any size larger that this will also result in the same worst case
performance.
