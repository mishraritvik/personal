The problem:
As seen in the output, only producer 0 ever outputs values of the Fibonacci
sequence, while producer 1 never outputs anything.

Why:
This unfair execution occurs because the producer 0 thread never yields. Even
though it is supposed to yield when the buffer is full, if the buffer never gets
full then it will never yield. Since the buffer is presumably never filling, the
producer 0 thread never yields to the producer 1 thread.
