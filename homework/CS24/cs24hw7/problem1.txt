The problem:
As seen in the output, only producer 0 ever outputs values of the Fibonacci
sequence, while the other producer never outputs anything.

Why:
This unfair execution occurs because producer 0 never yields. Even though it is
supposed to yield when the buffer is full, if this never occurs then it will
never yield, and this is what seems to be occuring.
