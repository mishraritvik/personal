a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

We can detect segfaults. So, if we set up the permission such that an access
results in a segfault, we will be able to detect when the page is accessed. So,
we can use the PROT_NONE permission.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

We can detect segfaults. So, if we set up the permission such that a write
results in a segfault, we will be able to detect when the page is written to.
So, we can use the PROT_READ permission.

g)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000" using FIFO policy:

47944 page loads.

h)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000" using CLOCK/LRU policy:
