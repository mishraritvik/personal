My code did not have error checking, and the result of attempting to do this
computation was an infinite loop. This infinite loop occurs in the first while
loop of the algorithm: we are repeatedly subtracting away the divisor (0) from
the remainder (10) until the remainder is negative. However, since subtracting
away 0 from a number leaves the number unchanged, no number of iterations of
this while loop will result in the remainder being negative. So, it never ends.
