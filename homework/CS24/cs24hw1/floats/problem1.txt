A. 0.00011001100110011001100110011001100... - 0.00011001100110011001100
   = 0.00000000000000000000000011001100110011...
   Since we only keep 23 decimal places, we lose everything that follows since
   it is an infinite representation.
   Answer: 0.000000000000000000000000110011001100[1100]... seconds

B. This is equivalent to 0.00011001100110011001100110011001100... >> 20, which
   is .1 * (1/2) ^ 20 = 9.54 * 10 ^ -8.
   Answer: 9.54 * 10 ^ -8 seconds

C. 100 hours = 100 * 60 * 60 * 10 = 3600000 .1 second intervals. So, the error
   will be 3600000 * 9.54 * 10 ^ -8 = .343 seconds off.
   Answer: .343 seconds

D. .343 seconds * 2000 meters / second = 686 meters off.
   Answer: 686 meters
